### Thoughts

I spent a total of about 2 1/2 to 3 hours across two nights gettting env setup and installing all the dependencies I used. I think I could take an hour to go through the styling and refactor out some replicated styling. I spent about an hour tonight deciding where the elements should go for smaller resolutions. I used Ant Design, Eslint, Sass, and React-Icons. Some things I would / could change would be to go in and adjust the less variables for some of the antd components I used frequently to make the resusable. With real data for the Updated and Upcoming events I would create a service that makes the api call and make an Event Component that I could just map the data into and generate how every many there are. This was a fun challenge to knock out. Let me know if you would like to see any changes, or have any Feedback!
